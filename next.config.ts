import type { NextConfig } from "next";
// Imports the TypeScript type definition for Next.js configuration.
// This does NOT add runtime code — it only helps with type checking and editor hints.

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
  // This is where all Next.js project settings go.
  // Examples include routing behavior, image optimization,
  // environment variables, performance flags, and build settings.
};
// Creates a configuration object that follows Next.js rules.
// TypeScript ensures only valid options can be added here.

export default nextConfig;
// Exports the configuration so Next.js can read it at build and runtime.
// Without this export, Next.js would ignore the file completely.
